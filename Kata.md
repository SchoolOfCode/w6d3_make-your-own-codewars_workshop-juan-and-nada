Scenario:

You find yourself alone in the jungle facing a group of lions ready to attack you,
but luckily you have a rifle with some ammo! In order to survive you have to kill all the lions before your
ammo and time runs out otherwise you are dead. You can only shoot one lion per second.

Create a function that predict the results which takes in the number of lions, the time you have and number of ammo.
If you die, it will return "Sorry!, you are dead, you've run out of ammo" or "Sorry!, you are dead, you've run of time "
If you surive, it will return "Congratulations! you survived!"

The function starts with:

function lionAttack(ammo, time, numberOfLions){
// your code here
}
