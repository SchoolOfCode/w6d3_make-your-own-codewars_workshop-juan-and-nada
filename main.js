//scenario: 
you find yourself alone in the jungle facing a group of lions ready to attack you, 
but luckly you have a rifle 
with some ammo. In order to survive you have to kill all the lions before your
 ammo and time run out otherwise you are 
dead. You can only shoot one lion per second.
Create a function that  predict the result which takes in the number of lions, 
the time you have and number of ammo.
If you died, it will return "sorry!, you are dead".
If not, it will return "congratulations! you survived!"

you died if...
ammo < lions 
 time < lions
 you live if...
 ammo >= lions and time => lions

// rifle with ammo
// number of lions 
// time  15 seconds

//ðŸ‘‰ Write the function your CodeWarriors will start with below here:
